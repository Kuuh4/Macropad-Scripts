# Description
These AHK Scripts are meant for a basic macropad model that doesn't have layered functionality on the go.
These were made taking into consideration personal use, but may useful to someone else.

Without the script, my macros are set to:
| Key 1      | Key 2      | Key 3      |C.ClockWise | ClockWise  |Knob_Click|
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Vol_Minus  | Play/Pause | Vol_Plus   | Prev_Track | Next_Track | Mute     |

Those inputs are taken by the script and translated taking into account the tables below

It's quite easy to change the values of the outputs to whatever you'd like to, for doing so, check [V2.0 AHK Documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/)
